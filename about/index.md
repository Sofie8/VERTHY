# About

I’m Sofie Thijs, founder of VERTHY, and an enthusiastic, forward-thinking biologist and data analyst. I earned a BSc in Biology and an MSc in Environmental & Health Sciences. During my PhD (2015), I isolated the soil bacterium *Raoultella ornithinolytica* strain TNT and discovered its **N-ethylmaleimide reductase (NEM)** gene. I described the genome, overexpressed the gene, purified the protein, and demonstrated that **NEM has nitroreductase activity toward TNT** with kinetics comparable to the PETN-reductase from *Enterobacter cloacae*.

As a postdoc in the Neufeld Lab (University of Waterloo, Canada), I co-developed **GORDIAN**—a density-gradient workflow to recover high-quality draft genomes from complex metagenomes—while deepening my bioinformatics expertise.

Now, as a postdoc at UHasselt, I lead applied microbiome projects that connect genomics, metabolomics, and field trials. I work on **PFAS phytoremediation (PLANTS)** and a **microbial toolbox for pollution remediation (MIBIREM)**. I develop and co-develop analysis tools (e.g., the **MANANAS** R-shiny pipeline), and test **seed treatments**, **foliar applications** of microbes/metabolites, and **natural soil minerals** to modulate pollutant uptake.

## What we do

We provide high-quality consultancy and hands-on support in **phytoremediation** and **microbiome-enabled environmental solutions**—from feasibility to field validation and success-control monitoring. Our work follows the **Code of Good Practice for Phytoremediation** and serves soil-remediation specialists, environmental consultants, regulators, municipalities, and agricultural professionals.
