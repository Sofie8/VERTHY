# Our Team

At VERTHY we work with a motivated team that is ready to support and advise clients in soil management, ecological remediation and applied genetics. We combine practical field expertise with international research collaborations to bring innovative yet realistic solutions.  
Below, we would like to introduce ourselves.

    <h3>Founder</h3>
    <p>Sofie is the founder of VERTHY and an enthusiastic, forward-thinking microbiologist. She earned her bachelor’s degree in Biology from Hasselt University and went on to complete a PhD focused on remediating sites polluted with explosives. During her postdoctoral research, she deepened her expertise in the plant–microbiome interaction, exploring how microbial communities can be leveraged for both environmental remediation and sustainable agriculture.

In 2019, Sofie authored the Code of Good Practice for Phytoremediation for OVAM, providing practical guidance for integrating plant-based remediation into site management. Her work bridges scientific discovery with real-world application — from designing microbial inocula to developing phytoremediation strategies that improve soil quality, enhance biodiversity, and support circular land use.

Growing up in her family’s garden in Peer, Belgium, Sofie developed a hands-on knowledge of plants and ecological systems at an early age. This practical background complements her scientific training, enabling her to design remediation solutions that are both technically robust and ecologically sound.

Through VERTHY, Sofie combines consultancy, remediation strategies, and genetic analyses to translate cutting-edge science into accessible tools for land managers, developers, and farmers. Her vision is to harness plant–microbe partnerships to clean contaminated soils while fostering productive, sustainable landscapes.

    <h3>Field engineers</h3>
    <p>Our field team comprising engineers and agricultural entrepeneurs ensures that scientific advice is directly translated into effective on-site actions. From preparing the soil and supporting microbial inoculation to guiding planting schemes and overseeing project implementation, they provide the practical expertise needed to turn strategies into measurable results. </p>

    <h3>Lab R&D inocula</h3>
    <p>Francisco Massot is VERTHY’s expert in upscaling microbial consortia for real-world applications. He earned his PhD studying the bacterial degradation of glyphosate and has since focused on how microbial communities can be engineered to accelerate the breakdown of persistent pollutants.

Together with VERTHY, Francisco has conducted fieldwork in Antarctica, studying the ecology of cold-tolerant, petroleum hydrocarbon–degrading bacteria. These insights provide an innovative avenue for enhancing oil biodegradation under European winter conditions, where low temperatures often slow natural attenuation processes.

At VERTHY, Francisco helps bridge fundamental microbiology and applied remediation, bringing cutting-edge microbiome approaches to some of the most challenging environments. His expertise ensures that laboratory findings can be scaled and applied to field projects in ways that are both practical and impactful.</p>
