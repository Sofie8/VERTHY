    <h3>Francisco Massot</h3>
    <p>Francisco Massot is the team expert in upscaling microbial consortia for real-world applications. Together we have done fieldwork in Antarctica to learn about the ecology of cold-tolerant petroleum hydrocarbon degradating bacteria as an avenue to spur oil biodegradation in European climate in wintertime. We work together to bring innovative microbiome approaches to challenging environments.</p>
