# About

My name is **Sofie Thijs**, founder of VERTHY. From an early age I have been fascinated by nature and the way our environment shapes our lives. That curiosity grew into a career in soil, ecology and genetics, with one clear goal: to contribute to a healthier and more sustainable environment.  

With a background in biology and environmental sciences, I have built up experience in soil analysis, ecological remediation, and genetic research on plants and microbes. Over the years I have learned how to connect laboratory research with practical applications in the field. Whether it is restoring contaminated land, testing microbial products, or supporting farmers with crop improvement, my work is always about turning science into solutions.  

At VERTHY, I bring together expertise in consultancy, ecological restoration, and advanced genetic analyses. What drives me is the challenge of making complex data useful and translating it into clear, practical advice. I believe that by combining scientific knowledge with hands-on experience, we can create tools that make soils cleaner and agriculture more resilient.
