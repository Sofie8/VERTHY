- title: PLANTS — PFAS phytoremediation
  group: featured
  description: >
    Plant–microbe strategies to lower PFAS in soils and crops; screen genotypes,
    inoculants/metabolites, and mineral amendments. Monitoring with qPCR,
    amplicon/shotgun sequencing, and metabolomics. Outputs: reduced uptake or
    enhanced degradation and a clear scale-up plan.
  tags: [PFAS, phytoremediation]

- title: MIBIREM — Microbial toolbox for remediation
  description: >
    Targeted isolation and community engineering of robust degraders; decision
    support via the MIBI-BIO model. Deliverables: validated strains/consortia,
    SOPs, and monitoring markers for real-world pilots.
  tags: [remediation, microbiome, modelling]

- title: Microbiome engineering for sustainable agriculture
  description: >
    Genome mining and plasmidomics to find traits for growth promotion, biocontrol,
    and pollutant degradation; seed/foliar treatments and field validation with
    success-control metrics.
