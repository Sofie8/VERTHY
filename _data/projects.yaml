- title: PLANTS — PFAS phytoremediation
  group: featured
  description: >
    Plant–microbe strategies to lower PFAS in soils and crops; screen genotypes,
    inoculants/metabolites, and mineral amendments. Monitoring with qPCR,
    amplicon/shotgun sequencing, and metabolomics. Outputs: reduced uptake or
    enhanced degradation and a clear scale-up plan.

- title: Powdery mildew resistance in cold climate
  description: >
    Breeding and selecting cold-hardy vines with durable resistance: field phenotyping, controlled inoculation, and marker screening of resistance loci.
    We validate lines under northern-season conditions and test biocontrol/beneficial microbes as part of an IPM strategy.

- title: Microbiome engineering for sustainable agriculture
  description: >
    Genome mining and plasmidomics to find traits for growth promotion, biocontrol,
    and pollutant degradation; seed/foliar treatments and field validation with
    success-control metrics.
