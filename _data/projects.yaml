- title: PFAS phytoremediation
  group: featured
  description: >
    Plantâ€“microbe strategies to lower PFAS in soils and crops; screen genotypes,
    inoculants/metabolites, and mineral amendments. Monitoring with qPCR,
    amplicon/shotgun sequencing, and metabolomics. Outputs: reduced uptake or
    enhanced degradation and a clear scale-up plan.
