## What we do

Our primary focus is providing high-quality consultancy in phytoremediation, from feasibility assessments to success control monitoring and field analyses. We offer expertise in qPCR analyses, evaluating the degradation potential of pollutants in accordance with the Code of Good Practice Phytoremediation, and assessing the feasibility of phytoremediation for various contaminants.

We support research and field applications by translating ideas and experimental data into actionable solutions for environmental remediation, sustainable agriculture, and microbial biotechnologies. Our services are valuable for soil remediation specialists, regulatory bodies, environmental consultants, and agricultural professionals seeking to implement scientifically sound remediation and monitoring approaches.

But the best way to understand the things we do is by looking at some of our example projects
