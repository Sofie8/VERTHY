# About

I am an enthusiastic, forward-thinking, passionate biologist and data-analyst. I pursued a bachelor in Biology, followed by a masters in Environmental and health sciences. During my PhD (2015) I isolated the bacterial strain, Raoultella ornithinolytica strain TNT, who was able to eat TNT (explosives) and I discovered its N-ethylmaleimide reductase (NEM) gene. I described the genome, overexpressed the gene, purified the protein, and showed that NEM has nitroreductase activity toward TNT with kinetic properties comparable to the PETN-reductase from Enterobacter cloacae.

As a postdoc in the Neufeld Lab (University of Waterloo, Canada) I helped develop GORDIAN—a GenOme Resolution density-gradient workflow to recover high-quality draft genomes from complex metagenomes—while deepening my bioinformatics expertise.

Now, as postdoc at UHasselt, I lead applied microbiome projects that connect genomics, metabolomics, and field trials. I work on PFAS phytoremediation (PLANTS) and a microbial toolbox for pollution remediation (MIBIREM). I develop and co-develop analysis tools (the MANANAS R-shiny pipeline) and test seed treatments, foliar applications of microbes/metabolites, and natural soil minerals to modulate pollutant uptake.

## What I do

I provide high-quality consultancy and hands-on support in phytoremediation and microbiome-enabled environmental solutions—from feasibility to field validation and success-control monitoring. My work follows the Code of Good Practice for Phytoremediation and is designed for soil-remediation specialists, environmental consultants, regulators, municipalities, and agricultural professionals.

** Who I work with **
- Soil & site remediation teams (public and private)
- Environmental consultancies & engineering firms
- Biotech companies
- Regulatory bodies & municipalities
- Agri-food companies & growers seeking climate-smart, nature-based solutions
- Grape breeders
- R&D teams that need microbiome expertise, data analysis, or pilot support

** Core services **
- Phytoremediation feasibility assessment
- Site diagnostics and sampling
- Molecular monitoring
- Pilot-design: plant-microbe interventions
- Bacteria inoculum development
- Succes control monitoring
- Downy mildew resistance plant genetic marker screening

But the best way to understand the things I do is by looking at some of my example projects
