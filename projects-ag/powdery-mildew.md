# Powdery Mildew Resistance in Cold Climate

Powdery mildew is one of the most damaging fungal diseases in viticulture, especially in northern regions with cooler climates.  
At VERTHY AG, we focus on breeding and selecting **cold-hardy vines** that combine strong resilience with quality traits.

Our work includes:
- **Field phenotyping** of vine collections in cold climate conditions.  
- **Controlled inoculations** to test plant response under standardized pressure.  
- **Marker-assisted screening** of resistance loci using next-generation sequencing (NGS).  

The result is a pipeline that connects **field performance** with **genetic markers**, allowing us to identify and propagate vines with durable mildew resistance.
