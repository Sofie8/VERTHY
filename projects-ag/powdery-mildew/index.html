<p>Powdery mildew is one of the most damaging fungal diseases in viticulture, especially in northern regions with cooler climates.<br>
At VERTHY AG, we focus on breeding and selecting <strong>cold-hardy vines</strong> that combine strong resilience with quality traits.</p>

<p>Our work includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Field phenotyping</strong> of vine collections in cold climate conditions.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Controlled inoculations</strong> to test plant response under standardized pressure.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Marker-assisted screening</strong> of resistance loci using next-generation sequencing (NGS).</li>
</ul>

<p>The result is a pipeline that connects <strong>field performance</strong> with <strong>genetic markers</strong>, allowing us to identify and propagate vines with durable mildew resistance.</p>
