<p>Microbial communities in soil and on crops are a powerful resource for sustainable farming.<br>
At VERTHY AG, we explore ways to <strong>engineer the plant microbiome</strong> to improve growth, reduce stress, and control pathogens.</p>

<p>Our approach combines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Genome mining, plasmidomics, and metabolomics</strong> to discover functional traits.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Bench-to-field workflows</strong>, from lab assays to pilot designs for seed and foliar treatments.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Formulation development and success-control metrics</strong> to ensure reliability in real-world conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Through this pipeline we aim to deliver <strong>microbial products</strong> that enhance crop performance while reducing reliance on chemicals â€” a step towards resilient and sustainable agriculture.</p>
