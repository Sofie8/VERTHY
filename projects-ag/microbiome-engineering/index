# Microbiome Engineering for Sustainable Agriculture

Microbial communities in soil and on crops are a powerful resource for sustainable farming.  
At VERTHY AG, we explore ways to **engineer the plant microbiome** to improve growth, reduce stress, and control pathogens.

Our approach combines:
- **Genome mining, plasmidomics, and metabolomics** to discover functional traits.  
- **Bench-to-field workflows**, from lab assays to pilot designs for seed and foliar treatments.  
- **Formulation development and success-control metrics** to ensure reliability in real-world conditions.  

Through this pipeline we aim to deliver **microbial products** that enhance crop performance while reducing reliance on chemicals â€” a step towards resilient and sustainable agriculture.
