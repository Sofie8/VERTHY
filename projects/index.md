I design and validate **plant–microbe solutions** for cleaner soils and resilient crops.  
From feasibility to field validation, our work follows the **Code of Good Practice for Phytoremediation** and combines **phytoremediation**, **microbiome engineering**, and **data-driven monitoring** (qPCR, amplicon/shotgun sequencing, metabolomics, modelling).

**Who I work with:** soil & site remediation teams, environmental consultancies, regulators & municipalities, agri-food companies, and R&D groups.

## Projects I run (at a glance)

- **PFAS phytoremediation**  
  Plant–microbe strategies to lower PFAS in soils and crops: screening plant genotypes, microbial inoculants/metabolites, and mineral amendments to reduce uptake or enhance degradation. Monitoring via soil analytics, plant-uptake, nutrient and soil type analyses, metagenomics, and metabolomics.

- **Powdery mildew resistance in cold climate**  
  Targeted strain isolation and community design for pollutant removal. Decision-support with the **MIBI-BIO** model. Deliverables include validated strains/consortia, protocols, and monitoring markers.

- **Microbiome engineering for sustainable agriculture**  
  Genome mining, plasmidomics, and metabolomics to uncover traits for plant growth promotion, biocontrol, and pollutant degradation. Bench-to-field workflows (seed and foliar treatments, formulation, and success-control metrics).

- **Data & monitoring pipelines**  
  **MANANAS** (R-shiny) for amplicon/shotgun analysis, custom qPCR assays, and reproducible reporting dashboards that link **genomes → traits → field performance**.
