We run projects from  PFAS phytoremediation, microbiome engineering, bacterial genetics and genetic marker screening for downy-mildew resistance in climate-smart grape vine breeding.

## Projects we run (at a glance)

- **PFAS phytoremediation**  
  Plant–microbe strategies to lower PFAS in soils and crops: screening plant genotypes, microbial inoculants/metabolites, and mineral amendments to reduce uptake or enhance degradation. Monitoring via soil analytics, plant-uptake, nutrient and soil type analyses, metagenomics, and metabolomics.

- **Powdery mildew resistance in cold climate**  
  Breeding and selecting cold-hardy vines with durable resistance: field phenotyping, controlled inoculation, and marker screening of resistance loci using NGS.

- **Microbiome engineering for sustainable agriculture**  
  Genome mining, plasmidomics, and metabolomics to uncover traits for plant growth promotion, biocontrol, and pollutant degradation. Bench-to-field workflows (seed and foliar treatments, formulation, and success-control metrics).

- **Data & monitoring pipelines**  
  **MANANAS** (R-shiny) for amplicon/shotgun analysis, custom qPCR assays, and reproducible reporting dashboards that link **genomes → traits → field performance**.
