# PFAS Phytoremediation

At VERTHY we explore **plant–microbe strategies** to lower PFAS levels in soils and crops.  
Our work combines ecological knowledge with advanced molecular tools to design effective remediation pathways.

### What we do
- Screen **plant genotypes**, microbial **inoculants**, microbial **metabolites**, and natural **mineral amendments**.  
- Monitor microbial and plant responses using **qPCR**, **amplicon and shotgun sequencing**, and **metabolomics**.  

### Expected outcomes
- **Reduced PFAS uptake** in crops.  
- **Enhanced degradation pathways** through optimized plant–microbe interactions.  
- A **clear scale-up plan** for field implementation.  

This project brings together laboratory innovation and practical field testing, with the goal of making contaminated soils safer and supporting sustainable land use.
